# NYCC-data-challenge

Hi all, 

Please see the report and code files uploaded. The HTML files are the interactive plots of the figures included in the report, but can't be seen in the .ipynb file. You can download these files to view them in your browser, which I recommend since they are interactive, or you can view the static png versions. Let me know if there's anything you need or if there are issues with viewing.
